Overview

### **Objective:*** Install the Prometheus Quickstart dashboard for CoreDNS into your New Relic account.

---

### Who doesn't love a good dashboard?

The Prometheus Quickstarts from New Relic help you to get curated experiences for services that expose Prometheus metrics, bundling everything you need to start monitoring like a pro right out of the box. These experiences include a dashboard, example alerts, and links to related documentation.

Remember the `app_values` in the `integrations_filter`?  There are Quickstarts available for the default values defined in that list.

Let's install one!

## **CoreDNS**

CoreDNS is a versatile, extensible DNS server that was created to replace the classic DNS server, BIND. It is written in the Go programming language and is designed to be easy to use and configure.

CoreDNS is capable of serving as a traditional authoritative DNS server, but it also includes a number of advanced features that make it useful in a variety of other contexts. For example, CoreDNS can be used as a DNS-based service discovery tool in containerized environments, as a load balancer, or as an API gateway.

## **CoreDNS (Prometheus) Dashboard**

Did you know you can install Quickstarts from within your New Relic account?

To Install the CoreDNS Quickstart dashboard in the New Relic platform, do the following:

Wrapping up

## **Lab Completed!**

You have now installed and configured the CoreDNS (Prometheus) dashboard into your New Relic Account and officially completed the FY24  SKO Prometheus Agent Lab.  Hopefully, you learned a few things and don't forget, you can take this course as many times as you need to!  Use it as a sandbox for further experimentation and learning.

For all of your hard work, you get to watch this cat viewing its Prometheus metrics in New Relic.
